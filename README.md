**Lift Off** is a React app featuring a handful of helpful calculators that assist with weight lifting, particularly the parts to do with math! 🧮

## Here's a rundown of how it helps my mornings:

### 🏋️‍♂️ Plates calculator:

I'm walking up to a barbell with a number in my head, but can't seem to finish the math... subtraction is pretty simple, but then I think of warm-ups and small plates, lose the number, start over... Not anymore! Input the weight you want to lift and the calculator will tell you what to put on either side of the barbell.

**Input:** working set weight in pounds;

**Output:** (weight - barbell / 2), separated into plate size/weight and counts to achieve plates per side;

### 📈 Warm Up Sets:

I'm ready to start warming up with the bar. My working set is all figured out and I feel... confused. So I want to pyramid up to a new weight, kind of considering a top set... Easy! Input your working set weight, in lbs or kg, and the calculator will provide novice and advanced sets of warm-up loads and recommended reps!

**Input:** working set weight, in pounds or kilograms;

**Output:** list of reps and pyramid-style warm-up loads for the novice or advanced category (novice category is recommended for <250lbs);

### 😤 One Rep Max:

I'm feeling great by the end of my program, I know I've gotten so much stronger - what better than a one-rep lift test at maximum load and effort to know where I stand? Well, keeping my spine in place is very much a priority, so this is! This calculator utilizes 7 of the most popular algorithms to estimate a 1rm, for lbs and kg, based on a personal record at lower loads and higher reps, which is exponentially safer than the alternative!

**Input:** weight in pounds or kilograms and rep count of your best personal record;

**Output:** an average of seven one rep max calculations (Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Lombardi, Wathen, Mayhew, O'Conner) to represent your estimated one rep max;

### ✨ Optimal Rep Ranges:

Wait, am I really going to try to lift just 5lbs less than my max for this!? Nah. Once you've calculated your estimated one rep max, input that weight here to get a list of calculated loads for each rep range to achieve an appropriate challenge and stimulus from your sets of an average exercise - never underestimate your strength again!

**Input:** estimated one rep max weight in pounds or kilograms;

**Output:** a list of optimal loads for three rep ranges based on percentage calculations - these act as a rough guide;

Lift Off keeps me on track for time and gains in the early hours when math is hard. I could have started drinking coffee before the gym, but instead, I fixed my problems with code 🤓

I hope it helps you get strong too! 💪
